		<h4>What does "Full" in Full Stack mean?</h4>
		<pre>

 <h4>What does "Stack" in Full Stack mean?</h4>
		<pre>

	and utilities that supports software development.
	
	The front end would have a HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

		<pre>
	LAMP is short for 
	
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation" target="_blank">Apache</a>

			1. Explain database: A database is a data organizer that helps businesses and companies
			organize information in servers
			<br>
			Ex: dentists, repair shops, etc.

			<br>
			<br>
			2. Explain MySQL: MySQL is a database, which is ranked second in the most-used databases. Developed
			by Oracle, which is ranked first in the most-used databases. MySQL is free while Oracle has paid service.

			<br>
			Fun Fact: The creator named it "MySQL" after his daughter, My.

			<br>
			<br>
			3. Explain SQL: "Structured Query Language" -- MySQl is a name for the database, while SQL is the LANGUAGE
			of this database used to answer questions such as: "which products get bought a lot and which isn't?"
			It's an international standard language that can work with MySQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL server, and many others!

			<br>
			<br>
			4. Explain PHP: PHP is a programming language that can connect the front end and back end together. It can read
			HTML forms then sends that form info into the server. It can also read the database, and sends that back to another HTML
			form. PHP is a server-side language, which is totally secure and private -- you can't really see PHP when you do a "view source".

			<br>
			<br>
			5. MySQL Table: It has rows(horizontal) and columns(vertical), where data is organized in cells. It looks like an Excel
			spreadsheet, but you'll realize that it's actually different. (find the perfect table on Google)

			<br>
			<br>
			6. MySQL from the CLI (command line interface) -- NTS, structure when done
			<br>
			The User Interface for databases are HTML pages WE create! --- CLI is where experts, where the Power Users can see inside
			of the database but in a very primitive, non-GUI way. In other words, CLI is for the DB experts, not for the users.
